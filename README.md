## Origin of Project

This project aims to develop a Life-Long learning Recommendation System for GRE word recommendation. The Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) is a standardized test that is an admissions requirement for many graduate schools in the United States and Canada and few in other countries. Standard Recommendation Systems can be classified into three major categories:
1. User-Based Filtering
2. Item-Based Filtering
3. Stereotypes/Demographics-Based Filtering

The project aims to develop two varieties of filtering systems, primarily:
1. **User-Based Filtering and Item-Based Filtering:** This methodology would better supplement traditional Item-Based Filtering with User-Based Filtering to provide revision schemes for individual/targetted students.
2. **Stereotypes/Demographics-Based Filtering and Item-Based Filtering:** This methodology aims to encapsulate a broad selection of weak words for a larger demographic. This filtering methodology aims to be readily deployable in a public setting, where a large number of people will be accessing and using the project.

## Parameters of Concern:

We aim to utilize the following parameters as base quantifiers for word recommendations for the above algorithms. We will first analyze the Stereotypes/Demographics-Based Filtering and Item-Based Filtering:

1. Unused Words
2. Words that are confusing together
3. Frequently mistaken words

For the User-Based Filtering and Item-Based Filtering, we aim to analyze the following parameters:

1. Unused Words
2. Words that are easily forgotten
3. Frequently mistaken words
